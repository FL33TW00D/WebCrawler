# WebCrawler, Indexer and Retriever
This code can:
1. Crawl a specified domain
2. Index the domain (with a variety of stemming & lemmatizing algorithms implemented for performance experiments).
4. Perform retrieval on the curated index.

Some features include:
1. Stopword removal
2. NLTK Lemmatizer
3. Porter Stemmer
4. TFIDF
5. Cosine Similarity Measure
6. Title Recognition 
7. Natural language processing to identify named entities.
8. Stopword Removal

The bulk of the valuable code is located in indexer.py & tfidf.py.
The WebCrawler was provided by: https://math.nist.gov/~RPozo/ngraph/webcrawler.html

This was for a 3rd Year Information Retreival module for which I received the highest grade on the module of 96%.
My system could recall more than 75% of the target domains.
